# survey_form
Django application that accepts a form submission and presents the submitted data on a results page.

The goal is to get familiar with sending POST requests through a form and displaying that information. Consider screenshots attached as a guide.

The program meets the following criteria:
1. http://localhost:8000 - displays a nice looking HTML form.  The form should be submitted to '/result'

2. http://localhost:8000/result - have this display a html template with the information that was submitted by POST
